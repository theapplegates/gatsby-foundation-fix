A simple post to test an image.

[Thanksgiving holiday travel](http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/holiday-travel-2021-forecast-how-to-prepare/index.html) could be a messy one, as forecast models continue to show the [potential for plunging temperatures and a "significant storm](http://www.cnn.com/2021/11/17/weather/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-travel/index.html)["](http://www.cnn.com/2021/11/17/weather/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-travel/index.html) in the coming week.

Depending on where you live, it may be best to leave early. Not everyone has flexibility in their travel plans, but if you do, Friday and Saturday appear to be better days than Sunday through Tuesday. 

Traveling by airline for the holiday? You may be in for a bumpy ride.
